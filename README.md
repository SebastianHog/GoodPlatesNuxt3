# GoodPlates website, made in Nuxt3

I initially made this in in Nuxt2, but as I have been learning nuxt3 during my current internship I deciced to upgrade my project to Nuxt3, and at the same time re-do everything to make sure I use my most up to date skills and knowledge.

I am now focusing on making every single component responsive when I create it, this site should be easily usable on large and small desktops, and also any mobile phone screen!
